        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: {
          correct: 'B is CORRECT. This is an inferior STEMI (ST elevation in II, III, aVF = RCA territory). Primary PCI is the gold standard for STEMI with door-to-balloon time target < 90 minutes. Every minute of delay increases myocardial necrosis. The catheterization lab must be activated immediately. Aspirin 325mg (loading dose) + P2Y12 inhibitor + anticoagulation should be given concurrently while the lab is being prepared.',
          whyNotA: 'A is INCORRECT. Morphine was historically used but recent data (CRUSADE registry, MONA acronym) shows morphine may worsen outcomes in ACS by delaying drug absorption and potentially reducing antiplatelet efficacy. It should NOT be the priority  reperfusion is. Additionally, morphine may mask ischemic pain without treating the underlying cause.',
          whyNotC: 'C is INCORRECT in this scenario because primary PCI is available and superior to thrombolytics when PCI can be performed within 90 minutes (door-to-balloon). Thrombolytics are used when PCI is unavailable or will be significantly delayed (>120 min). Thrombolytics carry risk of intracranial hemorrhage (0.5-1%) which primary PCI avoids.',
          whyNotD: 'D is INCORRECT. Cardiac MRI is a non-emergent imaging modality used for tissue characterization, myocarditis evaluation, or viability assessment. It is NEVER the priority in acute STEMI. The diagnosis is already clear from the ECG, and time is myocardium  MRI would cause unacceptable delay.',
          whyNotE: 'E is INCORRECT. Observation for 2 hours is appropriate for NSTEMI or unstable angina with intermediate risk, not for STEMI. STEMI requires emergent reperfusion within 90 minutes of first medical contact. Anticoagulation alone without reperfusion is inadequate.',
          keyTakeaway: 'STEMI = emergent primary PCI < 90 min (door-to-balloon). ST elevation in II, III, aVF = inferior MI (RCA/LCx). Check right-sided leads (V3R/V4R) for RV involvement  avoid nitrates if RV infarct suspected (preload dependent).',

        correctAnswer: 'B',
        explanation: {
          correct: 'B is CORRECT. CT angiography of the chest (CT-A) is the gold standard for diagnosing aortic dissection. This patient has the classic triad: (1) tearing/ripping quality chest pain, (2) hypertension as risk factor, (3) pulse/pressure differential between arms (>20 mmHg difference is classic for dissection). CT-A identifies the type (Type A = ascending, surgical emergency; Type B = descending, medical management), extent, branch involvement, and complications.',
          whyNotA: 'A is INCORRECT as the primary test. Troponin may be mildly elevated in dissection if the dissection extends to the coronary ostia, but it is not diagnostic and can mislead the clinician toward ACS. The key distinguishing feature here is the BP differential and tearing quality  CT-A should be prioritized.',
          whyNotC: 'C is PARTIALLY CORRECT  echocardiography (especially TEE  transesophageal echo) can diagnose dissection and is useful when the patient is too unstable for CT. However, TTE has poor sensitivity for dissection (< 60%), while CT-A is > 95% sensitive. In a stable patient, CT-A is preferred.',
          whyNotD: 'D is INCORRECT. D-dimer is used to rule out PE (high sensitivity, low specificity). In aortic dissection, D-dimer may be elevated but is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule in dissection. D-dimer is not part of the dissection diagnostic algorithm.',
          whyNotE: 'E is INCORRECT. V/Q scan is used for PE diagnosis when CT-PA is contraindicated (contrast allergy, renal failure). There is no respiratory component or PE risk factors in this presentation.',

Pericarditis classically presents with: (1) sharp positional chest pain worse supine, improved leaning forward (pericardial friction rub position), (2) pleuritic component (worse with inspiration), (3) post-viral onset (typically Coxsackievirus B), (4) DIFFUSE ST elevation (saddle-shaped, not focal like STEMI) with PR depression. Treatment: NSAIDs + colchicine. Avoid exercise for 3 months. Look for pericardial effusion on echo.',
          whyNotA: 'A is INCORRECT. STEMI causes FOCAL ST elevation in contiguous leads (e.g., V1-V4 for anterior, II/III/aVF for inferior), not DIFFUSE ST elevation across all leads. STEMI pain is typically crushing, not pleuritic or positional. Age 25 with viral antecedent = pericarditis.',
          whyNotB: 'B is INCORRECT. Pleuritis causes pleuritic chest pain but does NOT cause ECG changes. Pleuritis is pleural inflammation (lung border), whereas pericarditis involves the pericardial sac around the heart  hence the cardiac ECG changes.',
          whyNotD: 'D is INCORRECT. PE causes pleuritic chest pain and can show ECG changes (S1Q3T3 pattern, sinus tachycardia, right heart strain  NOT diffuse ST elevation). PE rarely occurs in healthy young adults without risk factors.',

This presentation is classic for lymphoma: B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss > 10%), generalized lymphadenopathy (cervical + axillary + inguinal = "three station adenopathy"), elevated LDH (indicator of lymphoma bulk/aggressiveness). Excisional lymph node biopsy is the GOLD STANDARD for lymphoma diagnosis  it provides the entire lymph node architecture (nodal architecture is critical for lymphoma subclass classification: follicular vs diffuse). FNA (choice A) is inadequate for lymphoma because it disrupts the architectural pattern needed for classification.',

Lymphoma subtype classification (Hodgkin vs non-Hodgkin, follicular vs diffuse large B-cell) REQUIRES the intact node architecture.
